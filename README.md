# Reconfigurable IoT Lockboxes Website

The recent addition of internet controlled locking (doors, Amazon boxes, etc.) is creating unique opportunities and security risks for customers. This project will focus on creating a simple IoT lock box with an emphasis on security and privacy for users. This security and privacy should extend both the person opening the lockbox and the company filling the lock box. Lock boxes need to be extremely low power or even "no power" with a possible serverless design to allow for a box to be opened only by an authorized user 10's or 100's of years in the future. Lock boxes need to be reconfigurable in that multiple boxes can be quickly connected and disconnect from banks of other boxes if so desired.
